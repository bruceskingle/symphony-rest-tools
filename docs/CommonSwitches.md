# Common Switches
The following common switches can be applied to most commands:

| Flag | Multiple Allowed | Meaning																																 |
|------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| v    | Yes							 | 	Verbose mode, the more v's the more detailed the output will be, up to 3. |
| i    | Yes							 | 	Interactive mode, once causes all required parameters to be prompted for twice causes optional parameters to be prompted as well. | 
| q 		| No              | Quiet mode. Does not make sense together with verbose mode! |
