# Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to install one of the binary releases. The platform neutral
[Command Line Release](GettingStarted/CommandLineInstall.md), or one of the binary GUI releases for [OSX](GettingStarted/OSXInstall.md), [Windows](GettingStarted/WindowsInstall.md), or [Linux](GettingStarted/LinuxInstall.md).

Alternatively you can clone the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/symphonyoss/symphony-rest-tools) and [Build From Source](Building.md).
